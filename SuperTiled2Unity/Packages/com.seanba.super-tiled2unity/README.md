# Readme

fixit - my todo list
- There will be two readmes (one here and one at project root). How should this be resolved?
- Figure out how to handle internal versioning
- What are our dependencies? Add them to the package.json file
- Test min spec
- How to get "View documentation", "View changelog", and "View licenses" to work in UPM for this package?
- Refactor the deployment script to make a zip or tar or whatever
